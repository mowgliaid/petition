To<br>
Deputy commissioner  - SAS Nagar,<br><br>


On 20.08.2020, an incident caught on CCTV in Phase 3B1, shook the entire region. We saw an animal mercilessly murdered in board daylight. This visual showcase represents the plight of many such community animals which yield mental and physical suffering bestowed unjustly by our society. <br><br>

<b>SAS Nagar has no district SPCA and no rescue ambulance service to assist injured animals in need. Furthermore, most civic bodies in the district do not show adherence to Animal Birth rules of 2001 under PCA, 1960.</b><br><br>

We request you to kindly work on a mechanism which includes greater participation of officials in charge and civil society members which leads to a greater reduction of such barbaric cases with an inevitable goal of making Mohali safer for everyone and which protects everyone. As anyone who violates and snatches the life of a voiceless is also near the realms our children and the most vulnerable people of our society. I also request you to kindly set up an emergency rescue ambulance service for injured animals so they receive the medical care they deserve.<br><br>

Yours sincerely,<br>
A Concerned Citizen
