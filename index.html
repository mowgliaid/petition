On 20.08.2020, an incident caught on CCTV in Phase 3B1, shook the entire region. I saw an animal mercilessly murdered in board daylight. This visual showcase represents the plight of many such community animals which yield mental and physical suffering bestowed unjustly by our society. <br><br>

<b>SAS Nagar has no district SPCA and no rescue ambulance service to assist injured animals in need.</b> Furthermore, most civic bodies in the district do not show adherence to Animal Birth rules of 2001 under PCA, 1960. <br><br>

I request you to kindly consider working on a mechanism which includes greater participation of officials in charge and civil society members which leads to a greater reduction of such barbaric cases with an inevitable goal of making Mohali safer for everyone and which protects everyone. As anyone who violates and snatches the life of a voiceless is also near the realms our children and the most vulnerable people of our society. I also request you to kindly consider setting up rescue ambulance service for injured animals in need.<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
